  <h1>Why Every Youth Should Join the Climate Change Movement Today</h1>
  <p><strong>By Giftson Lewis Situma</strong> | July 19, 2025</p>

  <h2>The Future Is in Our Hands</h2>
  <p>
    Climate change is no longer a distant threat—it's a crisis we are living through.
    From intense heat waves to rising sea levels and unpredictable rainfall, the signs are clear.
    But so is the solution: young people like you and me standing up, speaking out, and taking action.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Youth Voices Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Youth are not just leaders of tomorrow—we are leaders of <strong>today</strong>.
    We bring energy, innovation, and fearlessness.
    Movements led by youth have already changed the world, from social justice to technology revolutions.
    The climate movement needs that same spark.
  </p>

  <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
  <p>You don’t need to be a scientist or politician to join the movement. Start where you are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🌱 Plant a tree and protect nature</li>
    <li>📢 Speak up on social media</li>
    <li>🧠 Educate your friends and family</li>
    <li>🧹 Join clean-ups and local eco projects</li>
    <li>📘 Advocate for eco-friendly policies in your school or community</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real Change Starts With You</h2>
  <p>
    The planet doesn’t need a handful of perfect people—it needs
    <strong>millions of imperfect people doing their part</strong>.
    When we act together, our collective power is unstoppable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join us at <strong>Youth Eco Lead</strong> as we green our communities and raise a generation of climate champions.
  </p>

  <h2>Be Part of the Movement</h2>
  <p>
    Share your eco actions with us and be featured in our campaigns.
    Let the world know that <strong>Kenyan youth are rising</strong> for the planet!
  </p>
  <p>
    Ready? 🌍 Let’s lead the change — one step, one tree, one voice at a time.
