  <h1>Meet Youth Eco Lead Founders: Why We Started the Initiative</h1>
  <p><strong>By Giftson Lewis Situma</strong> | July 19, 2025</p>

  <h2>The Dream That United Us</h2>
  <p>
    It began as a conversation between friends in Athi River — about pollution, deforestation, and youth unemployment.
    We realized we could connect these challenges through one powerful solution: <strong>youth-led environmental action</strong>.
    That’s how Youth Eco Lead was born.
  </p>

  <h2>Meet the Team Behind the Movement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Giftson Lewis Situma – Team Leader:</strong> Passionate about mobilizing and empowering youth through action, Giftson believes change begins with us — and that no voice is too small.</li>
    <li><strong>Jacinta Wayua – Social Media Coordinator:</strong> She gives the movement its digital wings, sharing real stories and amplifying our green message online.</li>
    <li><strong>George Omondi – Project Coordinator:</strong> A strategist with a green heart, George ensures all eco projects are well-planned and impactful.</li>
    <li><strong>Juma Munga – Mobilizer:</strong> The connector! Juma gets the boots on the ground by rallying youths from towns, schools, and villages.</li>
    <li><strong>Miss Anne Kariuki – Communications Lead:</strong> Anne crafts the voice of the movement — making sure our message is clear, hopeful, and bold.</li>
    <li><strong>Mr. Samson Ambenje – Finance Manager:</strong> He handles the numbers so we can handle the planting. Transparent, organized, and green at heart.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Mission Is Simple</h2>
  <p>
    To <strong>empower young people</strong> to take environmental leadership and <strong>restore our planet</strong> one action at a time.
    We don’t wait for permission — we take initiative. We don’t just plant trees — we grow futures.
  </p>

  <h2>Join Us on This Journey</h2>
  <p>
    We invite every youth, teacher, donor, and dreamer to join the Youth Eco Lead family.
    Together, we’re not just fighting climate change — we’re building a generation that leads the change.
  </p>

  <p>Are you ready to grow with us? 💚</p>
