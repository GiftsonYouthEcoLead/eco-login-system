  <h1>How Youth Are Greening Athi River—One Tree at a Time</h1>
  <p class="author">By Giftson Lewis Situma — Youth Eco Lead</p>

  <p>Athi River, once a fast-developing town plagued by pollution and deforestation, is now witnessing a green revolution—and it’s being led by the youth. At the heart of this movement is a passionate group of young changemakers under the banner <strong>Youth Eco Lead</strong>, planting hope in the form of trees.</p>

  <h2>🌱 A Movement Rooted in Purpose</h2>
  <p>We believe that protecting the environment isn't just the job of governments and big organizations—it starts with us. With every tree we plant, we are reclaiming the land, restoring biodiversity, and building a greener future for our community.</p>

  <p>What began as a small initiative has grown into a local movement involving schools, churches, and community-based youth groups. We’re not only planting trees—we’re planting values of responsibility, love for nature, and climate action.</p>

  <h2>🌿 Tree by Tree, We Transform Lives</h2>
  <p>So far, our team has planted over <em>[insert actual number]</em> trees across different areas in Athi River. From dusty school compounds to dry community fields, our green fingerprints are starting to show. Each tree planted is a step toward:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restoring green cover</li>
    <li>Reducing carbon emissions</li>
    <li>Creating shade and beauty in public spaces</li>
    <li>Teaching the next generation to care</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>👩🏽‍🌾 Empowering Youth Through Action</h2>
  <p>Youth Eco Lead gives young people a platform—not just to talk, but to act. We host tree planting events, clean-up drives, eco-education workshops, and awareness campaigns. Every activity is a reminder that small actions by many can create big impact.</p>

  <p>We also collaborate with local authorities, landowners, and environmental experts to ensure sustainability in every tree we plant.</p>

  <h2>📸 In Photos: The Faces of the Movement</h2>
  <p>[Insert photo gallery or video here]</p>
  <p>Each smiling face in these photos tells a story of hope, commitment, and change. We’re not waiting for the future—we’re creating it.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re a student, a parent, or a fellow environmental enthusiast, there’s a place for you in our mission. Join us as we continue to green Athi River and inspire a generation of eco-leaders.</p>
